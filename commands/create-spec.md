# Create Spec

Create a detailed spec for a new feature with technical requirements and documentation.

Use the layered guidance provided by AgentÂ OS:
- Global context: `@AGENTS.md`
- Project context: `@./AGENTS.md`
- Spec execution guidance: `@.agent-os/specs/<date-name>/AGENTS.md`
- Workflow details: `@.agent-os/instructions/core/create-spec.md`

Run this command after planning the product so each spec captures goals, approach, and scope before tasks are generated.
