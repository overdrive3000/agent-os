# Plan Product

Plan a new product and install Agent OS in its codebase.

Use the layered guidance provided by Agent OS:
- Global context: `@AGENTS.md`
- Project context: `@./AGENTS.md`
- Workflow details: `@.agent-os/instructions/core/plan-product.md`

Follow the command-driven flow to collect product vision, roadmap, and tech stack before building specs.
