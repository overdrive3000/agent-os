# /create-spec

Generate a spec folder with requirements, technical approach, and supporting docs.

## When to run
- You have an approved feature idea and aligned stakeholders.
- After `/plan-product` or `/analyze-product` has established product docs.

## Steps
1. Load guidance: `@AGENTS.md`, `@./AGENTS.md`, and relevant spec instructions when created.
2. Provide feature goals, user stories, constraints, and success criteria.
3. Review the generated spec folder (SRD, technical spec, optional sub-specs).
4. Confirm scope and dependencies before `/create-tasks`.
